TODO for Net::DNS::SEC package.

- The create methods for the SIG class take a path to a private key
  file as one of their parameters. This means that for every signature
  to be created file access is needed. We could speed this up by
  allowing to pass a private key object. 

  To enable this we will need to implement e a private key class like
  Net::DNS::RR::SIG::Private. Don't expect this to be done any time
  soon but please let me know if you plan to implement a signer using
  the Net::DNS::SEC extensions, this plan may get a little priority
  then.
