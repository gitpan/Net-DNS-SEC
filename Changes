Revision history for Perl extension Net::DNS::SEC.


0.07 October 2 2002

   FEAT: - Added demo/make-signed-keyset, a contribution by Wes Griffin.

   FEAT: - Removed dependency on Math::Pari by porting away from
	   Crypt::DSA to Crypt::OpenSSL::DSA (version 0.10). This should
	   increase portability over platform.

           T.J. Mather, the Crypt::OpenSSL::DSA maintainer has been
	   particularly helpfull and responsive by adding a few
	   methods to the DSA modules.

0.06 August 16 2002

   NOTE: In one of ther versions prior to Net::DNS 0.26 a bug
         got introduced that made Net::DNS::SEC break. The bug was fixed in
	 version 0.27.

   BUG:  - Check on the existence of the private file improved in SIG.pm

         - signame got trailing dot with the create methods and not with
	   others.

   FEAT: - Added privatekeyname method to KEY.pm
         - Started work on Net::DNS::Keyset.
         - Added RSA/SHA1 (algorithm ID 5) to SIG.pm. Patch supplied by
	   Andy Vaskys,  Network Associates Laboratories.
	 - Rewrote regexp's to not use $' (Postmatch).

0.05 and 0.04 June 17, 2002

    BUG:  Makefile.PL needed a fix for unused dependency. This failed
	  made the installation fail :-(. 0.04 introduced another failing
	  dependency.

    DOC:  Clarified the documentation at points.

    DOC: Few Clarifications

0.02 June 4, 2002

    First CPAN Release.
    Some modifications to the packaging.


0.01 May 25, 2002  

    Version 0.01 of the package is an alpha for CPAN release.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The extensions used to be published as a modified version of
Net::DNS. The history of those is documented below.

0.20-DNSSEC-0.2:
  
  Branched off Net::DNS version 0.20 release (CPAN May 15, 2002)


0.20-DNSSEC-0.1:

  This version had limited distribution
  
  First patch against a version 0.20 snapshot (2002-03-27).
  http://www.dyndns.org/~ctriv/net-dns-snaps/2002/03/


  Modified t/09-dnssec.t; uses Test::More now and includes a number of
  self consistency checks.
 

  DOC   Cleaned up the documentation and removed some references to functions
	and libraries that where not used anyway.

  FIX   'aesthetic' patch supplied by Simon Josefsson reordering the NXT
        RR map for the  print  method.
 
  FEAT  Added checks on keytype and updated to latest specs for DS 
        Added SIG0 support. See Net::DNS::Packet for details. The verify and
	create methods of SIG.pm where modified somewhat to cope with the 
	difference.
        Changed RSA backend from Crypt::RSA to Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA because
	Crypt::RSA failed during a 'loss of Math::Pari precision in 
	Crypt::Primes'.
  

0.19-DNSSEC-0.5: 

  BUG   DS create method: Hash calculation was done over concattination of name
        and key material while the hash should be taken over concatenation of
        canonical name and key rdata. (Fix by Mike Schiraldi)


0.19-DNSSEC-0.4: 
  Added CERT support: Courtesy of Mike Schiraldi <raldi@research.netsol.com> 
        for VeriSign
 
  BUG Fixed MANIFEST file. make dist will result in proper module tar ball
 

0.19-DNSSEC-0.3: 
  Solved patch problems that where due to the 
  $Id: Changes,v 1.9 2002/10/02 10:19:27 olaf Exp $ in headers not 
  being from the original distribution.

  Added DSA signature creation

  Added DS support 
        You have to uncomment line 77 in Net/DNS.pm to fully enable DS
	This will assign QTYPE 93 to the DS RR.
	That value is not assigned by IANA. 


  Added this README.DNSSEC file

  Added t/09-dnssec.t to the test script with a number of consistency checks.
        after patching the original distribution direction
        perl Makefile.PL
        make test 
        will call this function among other things.

  BUG   KeyID set to 0 for null keys.

  BUG   Sorting of canonical RDATA; 
	Data over which SIG was created was not sorted properly (RFC2535 
        sect 8.3) causing signature verification errors for RDATA within 
	a RRset having different length (e.g. some NS RRsets would not 
	verify.)

0.19-DNSSEC-0.2: 
  First somewhat public release.
