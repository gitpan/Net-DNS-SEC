Net::DNS::SEC - DNSSEC extensions to Net::DNS
=============================================


1. GENERAL INFO.

  DNSSEC is defined in RFC 2535 and related RFCs.

  The extensions provide the following additional features on top of
  the Net::DNS package (http://www.net-dns.org/ version 0.21).

  - DS, SIG, KEY and NXT records. These are all implemented as RR
    objects.  The cryptography has been implemented using Crypt::DSA,
    Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA and related modules.

  The reason for not making these RRs a part of the regular Net::DNS
  distribution is that they rely on crypto modules that do not easily
  port.

  The DNSSEC protocol is a moving target. Follow the IETF DNSEXT working
  group if you are interested in the protocol developments. We try to 
  keep the code in sync with the development.

  Also see the 'pod' documentation in: 
       Net::DNS::RR::SIG
       Net::DNS::RR::KEY
       Net::DNS::RR::DS
       Net::DNS::RR::NXT

2. Dependencies

  This package relies on Net-DNS version 0.21 or higher.
  since that contains a number of place holders for 
  Net::DNS::SEC functionality.

  Among other straightforward routines you will need to have
  Crypt::DSA, Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA and Math::Pari installed.

  The package was developed on FreeBSD 4.5 with perl5.6.1, I used
  the ports to install Math::Pari and the Crypto libraries.
  
  'make test' is successful with perl5.00503.
  


3. Install

  Use CPAN.

  perl -MCPAN -e shell;
  cpan> install Net::DNS::SEC
  

  Alternatively install this package manually:
    tar -xvzf Net-DNS-SEC-??.tar.gz
    cd  Net-DNS-SEC-??.tar.gz
    perl Makefile.PL
    make 
    make test
    make install

  'perl Makefile.PL' will test if all dependencies are in place. 
  'make test' will do some tests that should all succeed once all
  dependencies are satisfied. Please report failures during the test 
  phase.


4. Maintenance

  If you find bugs in the extensions or have DNSSEC feature request
  please mail to net-dns-sec@ripe.net.

  Net::DNS is maintained by a team lead by Chris Reinhardt. They have
  been so kind to include a number of hooks for Net::DNS::SEC in the
  Net::DNS package. If you have problems with Net::DNS in general see:
  http://www.net-dns.org/



5. History

  The modules in this package have somewhat of a history as a set of 
  patches to the original Net::DNS package. 

  Version 0.02 is the first distribution of the DNSSEC security
  for CPAN.  See the Changes file for more information.


6. Acknowledgements

  Thanks to the numerous folk that took an interest during development.
  Thanks to Chris Reinardt for putting the hooks in Net::DNS and suggesting
  some improvements to the package.
